Description: Bidirectional spline-based trajectory reconstruction with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck 
    uncertainty modelling. Reconstructs fragmented animal tracking trajectories using 
    uncertainty-weighted likelihood ranking to intelligently link trajectory segments 
    broken by occlusions, identity swaps, or tracking failures. Features bidirectional 
    reconstruction, GAM-based prediction, kinematic feasibility filtering, and 
    multi-individual support with video overlay capabilities.
