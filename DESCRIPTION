Description: Provides robust methods for processing trajectory data with discontinuous 
    movement paths. Implements velocity-based anomaly detection and Savitzky-Golay 
    smoothing with missing value handling. Features include
    - Discontinuity removal using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
    - Path segmentation with velocity thresholding
    - Adaptive Savitzky-Golay filtering with interpolation
    - Temporal alignment preservation
