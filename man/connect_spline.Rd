\usage{
connect_spline(
  segments_summary,
  processed_df,
  time_bias = 10,
  projection_dist = 10,
  min_points = 25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments_summary}{Summary of path segments with start/end positions and times}

\item{processed_df}{The processed tracking data with segment IDs}

\item{time_bias}{Weight applied to temporal distance in path connection}

\item{projection_dist}{Maximum number of future segments to consider in the projection}

\item{min_points}{Minimum number of points to use for spline fitting (defaults to 25)}
}
\value{
Vector of segment IDs that form the connected path
Spline Path Connection Method using mgcv

Uses GAM spline models from mgcv package to predict and connect path segments.
This method can capture non-linear trends better than simple linear regression.
