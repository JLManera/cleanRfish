\title{Process Multiple Individuals with Temporal Priority Ground Truth Selection}
\usage{
clean_track(
  df_raw,
  window = 20,
  z_thresh = 3,
  speed_threshold_quantile = 0.9999,
  smooth_method = "savitzky_golay",
  smooth_window = "not_specified",
  min_movement = 500,
  diagnostic_plots = FALSE,
  min_candidates = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_raw}{Data frame with columns: time, x1, y1, x2, y2, etc. for multiple individuals}

\item{window}{Time window threshold for gap detection (seconds)}

\item{z_thresh}{Z-score threshold for jump detection (default: 3)}

\item{speed_threshold_quantile}{Quantile for maximum speed threshold (default: 0.9999)}

\item{smooth_method}{Smoothing method: "savitzky_golay" or "moving_average" (default: "savitzky_golay")}

\item{smooth_window}{Smoothing window size. If "not_specified", calculated from frame rate}

\item{min_movement}{Minimum movement required for ground truth segment (default: 500)}

\item{diagnostic_plots}{Whether to generate diagnostic plots (default: FALSE)}

\item{min_candidates}{Minimum number of candidate segments to consider (default: 5)}
}
\value{
List containing:
\item{tracks}{Data frame with original, reconstructed, and smoothed coordinates}
\item{plots}{Diagnostic plots (if diagnostic_plots = TRUE)}
}
\description{
The primary trajectory cleaning function for multi-individual tracking data.
Uses the first (temporally) segment that meets criteria as the ground truth,
rather than the largest segment. This approach minimizes backward propagation
and prioritizes forward propagation, which tends to be more accurate.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load tracking data with multiple individuals
df <- read.csv("multi_track.csv")

# Process with temporal priority ground truth
result <- clean_track(df, window = 20)

# Access reconstructed tracks
tracks <- result$tracks

# With diagnostic plots
result <- clean_track(df, window = 20, diagnostic_plots = TRUE)
}
