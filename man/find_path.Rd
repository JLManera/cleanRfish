}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing tracking data with time, x, and y coordinates}

\item{method}{Method for jump detection: either "EM" (Expectation-Maximization) or "MAD" (Median Absolute Deviation)}

\item{connection_method}{Method for connecting path segments: "kalman" (Kalman filtering),
"linear" (Linear regression), or "spline" (Spline interpolation)}

\item{time_bias}{Weight applied to temporal distance in path connection (higher values
penalize larger time gaps more heavily)}

\item{report_jumps}{Logical; if TRUE, includes jump detection results in output}

\item{include_segment_id}{Logical; if TRUE, includes segment identifiers in output}

\item{prob_threshold}{Probability threshold for classifying jumps when using EM method}

\item{projection_dist}{Maximum number of future segments to consider in projection}

\item{process_noise}{Process noise parameter for Kalman filter (controls model uncertainty)}

\item{measurement_noise}{Measurement noise parameter for Kalman filter (controls observation uncertainty)}

\item{min_points}{Minimum number of points to use for the selected connection method}
}
\value{
Data frame with identified path
}
\description{
This function identifies a continuous path by connecting trajectory segments using
the specified connection method.
