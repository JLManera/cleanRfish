\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing tracking data with time, x, and y coordinates}

\item{method}{Method for jump detection: either "EM" (Expectation-Maximization) or "MAD" (Median Absolute Deviation)}

\item{connection_method}{Method for connecting path segments: "kalman" (Kalman filtering),
"linear" (Linear regression), or "spline" (Spline interpolation)}

\item{p}{Polynomial order for Savitzky-Golay smoothing (default is 3)}

\item{n}{Filter length for Savitzky-Golay smoothing (must be odd, default is 13)}

\item{time_bias}{Weight applied to temporal distance in path connection}

\item{process_noise}{Process noise parameter for Kalman filter (controls model uncertainty)}

\item{measurement_noise}{Measurement noise parameter for Kalman filter (controls observation uncertainty)}

\item{min_points}{Minimum number of points to use for the selected connection method}
}
\value{
Data frame with identified and smoothed path
}
\description{
This function combines path finding and smoothing into a single pipeline.
It first identifies a continuous path using jump detection and the selected connection method,
then applies Savitzky-Golay smoothing to the resulting trajectory.
