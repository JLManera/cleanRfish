\usage{
connect_kalman_projection(
  segments_summary,
  processed_df,
  time_bias = 10,
  projection_dist = 10,
  process_noise = 0.1,
  measurement_noise = 1,
  min_points = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments_summary}{Summary of path segments with start/end positions and times}

\item{processed_df}{The processed tracking data with segment IDs}

\item{time_bias}{Weight applied to temporal distance in path connection (higher values penalize larger time gaps more heavily)}

\item{projection_dist}{Maximum number of future segments to consider in the projection}

\item{process_noise}{Process noise parameter (controls model uncertainty)}

\item{measurement_noise}{Measurement noise parameter (controls observation uncertainty)}

\item{min_points}{Minimum number of points to use for Kalman filtering (defaults to 100)}
}
\value{
Vector of segment IDs that form the connected path
}
\description{
Uses Kalman filtering to predict and connect path segments with probabilistic ranking.
If the current segment has fewer than the minimum required points, this function
will incorporate points from previously included segments to ensure robust predictions.
