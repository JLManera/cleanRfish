\title{Detect Jumps Using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)}
\usage{
detect_jumps_MAD(df, mad_multiplier = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing tracking data with time, x, and y coordinates}

\item{mad_multiplier}{Multiplier for Median Absolute Deviation to set the threshold}
}
\value{
Data frame with additional columns for velocity metrics and jump classification
}
\description{
This function identifies jumps or discontinuities in tracking data using
the Median Absolute Deviation method, which is robust to outliers.
