\title{Linear Regression Path Connection Method}
\usage{
connect_linear_regression(
  segments_summary,
  processed_df,
  time_bias = 10,
  projection_dist = 10,
  min_points = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments_summary}{Summary of path segments with start/end positions and times}

\item{processed_df}{The processed tracking data with segment IDs}

\item{time_bias}{Weight applied to temporal distance in path connection}

\item{projection_dist}{Maximum number of future segments to consider in the projection}

\item{min_points}{Minimum number of points to use for regression (defaults to 20)}
}
\value{
Vector of segment IDs that form the connected path
}
\description{
Uses linear regression to predict and connect path segments with Euclidean distance ranking.
This method is computationally efficient but less sophisticated than Kalman filtering.
The function uses at most 40 points for regression to maintain efficiency.
