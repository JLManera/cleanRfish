\title{Detect Jumps Using Expectation-Maximization (GMM)}
\usage{
detect_jumps_EM(
  df,
  prob_threshold,
  min_velocity_points = 50,
  mad_multiplier = 8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing tracking data with time, x, and y coordinates}

\item{prob_threshold}{Probability threshold above which a point is classified as a jump}

\item{min_velocity_points}{Minimum number of velocity points required to use GMM method}

\item{mad_multiplier}{Multiplier for Median Absolute Deviation (used as fallback)}
}
\value{
Data frame with additional columns for jump probability and classification
}
\description{
This function identifies jumps or discontinuities in tracking data by fitting
a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to velocity distributions using Expectation-Maximization.
